# Terminal Shell

This project was done entirely by Austin Brown

This program is a simple shell used within the terminal. 
It can run any basic system process. Added functionality includes 
the ability to change directories with "cd", the ability to add
spaces to a file name using "" or \\, and the ability to stop the 
program by typing "exit".

## Notable stuff that is not doable in this program:

- << and >>
- 2> and 2<
- Piping
